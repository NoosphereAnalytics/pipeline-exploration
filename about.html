            <h2>What is “Noosphere Analytics”?</h2>
            <p>
                This company is currently a single proprietorship LLC owned by <strong>Morgan Foster</strong>.
                Including her time working for
                <a href="https://www.ewa.com/" target="_blank">Electronic Warfare Associates</a> (2009-2013) 
                and the 
                <a href="https://arl.devcom.army.mil/" target="_blank">Army Research Laboratory</a> (2009) 
                during university, Morgan has 16 years of experience building software systems as a technology professional.
                Notably she has also worked on data infrastructure (Facebook, Box), compiler and static analysis implementation (Mozilla, Twitter, Google) 
                and automating workflows via Machine Learning (Google).
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, she re-implemented Array sorting in the SpiderMonkey JavaScript Engine (notably
                used in 
                <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/products/bloomberg-terminal/" target="_blank">Bloomberg terminals</a>
                at the time) leading to a 5x improvement in performance:
                <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/gecko-dev/commit/6f74efb51b3089ee8321f97e86c7c6ef7574f596" target="_blank">link to Morgan's diff</a>.
                She also
                <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/gecko-dev/commit/46f9414ab1a271debd7ac5abe5e1eb6e72606943" target="_blank">implemented many features</a>
                from and participated in global discussions about the
                <a href="https://ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-262/" target="_blank">ECMA standard</a>.
                Particularly around the way that dates are parsed across web browsers. She is provided as a reference
                <a href="https://www.proposals.es/proposals/uniform%20parsing%20of%20quasi-standard%20Date.parse%20input" target="_blank">here</a>.
                (Note: “Phillips” is Morgan’s maiden name).
            </p>
            <p>
                You can also see she was among the earliest contributors to a key component of the flagship
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAssembly" target="_blank">WebAssembly</a> runtime
                environment:
                <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/commits?author=usize" target="_blank">wasmtime</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                These experiences have allowed her to build a diverse skill set which lends itself well
                to the problem of building a “smart data pipeline”. That is, a data pipeline with autonomous
                components such that they are able to locate and process data that would have historically
                required human oversight to reach. Case in point, school board documents which are published
                in myriad formats and hosted across a diverse array of platforms which vary wildly in terms
                of sophistication and accessibility.
            </p>
            <p>
                Morgan is passionate about this project through volunteer work in her local community,
                serving on the board of directors for the
                <a href="https://www.whatcomdrc.org/contact-us" target="_blank">Whatcom Dispute Resolution Center</a>
                in Bellingham, Washington. She noticed heated discussions in the community around Title IX
                implementations where school officials appeared to vilify certain groups of students. When
                later, nearby to her home, a student from this group
                <a href="https://www.kiro7.com/news/local/bellingham-high-student-attacked-being-transgender/E3CH4XLD6NGX3IULLWH5EHXUJ4/" target="_blank">
                    was attacked
                </a>
                she decided to investigate how widespread the issue was and found a surprising lack of clarity via data.
                She built the original prototype of this system in order to solve her own desire to collect
                that data and build that clarity.
