            <h2>What is “Noosphere Analytics”?</h2>
            <p>
                This company is currently a single proprietorship LLC owned by <strong>Morgan Foster</strong>.
                Including her time working for
                <a href="https://www.ewa.com/" target="_blank">Electronic Warfare Associates</a> (2009-2013) 
                and the 
                <a href="https://arl.devcom.army.mil/" target="_blank">Army Research Laboratory</a> (2009) 
                during university, Morgan has 16 years of experience building software systems as a technology professional.
                Notably she has also worked on data infrastructure (Facebook, Box), compiler and static analysis implementation (Mozilla, Twitter, Google) 
                and automating workflows via Machine Learning (Google).
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, she re-implemented Array sorting in the SpiderMonkey JavaScript Engine (notably
                used in 
                <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/products/bloomberg-terminal/" target="_blank">Bloomberg terminals</a>
                and the Firefox web browser) leading to a 5x improvement in performance:

                She also
                <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/gecko-dev/commit/46f9414ab1a271debd7ac5abe5e1eb6e72606943" target="_blank">implemented many features</a>
                from and participated in global discussions about the
                <a href="https://ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-262/" target="_blank">ECMA standard</a>.
                Particularly around the way that dates are parsed across web browsers. She is provided as a reference
                <a href="https://www.proposals.es/proposals/uniform%20parsing%20of%20quasi-standard%20Date.parse%20input" target="_blank">here</a>.
                You can also see she was among the earliest contributors to a key component of the flagship
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAssembly" target="_blank">WebAssembly</a> runtime
                environment:
                <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/commits?author=usize" target="_blank">wasmtime</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                These experiences have allowed her to build a diverse skill set which lends itself well
                to the problem of building a “smart data pipeline”. See our <a href="index.html">white paper</a> to learn more.
            </p>
            <h3> Origins of Noosphere Analytics </h3>
            <p>
                Morgan built her original autonomous pipeline prototype in response to the needs of her local community. Through volunteer work,
                serving on the board of directors for the
                <a href="https://www.whatcomdrc.org/contact-us" target="_blank">Whatcom Dispute Resolution Center</a>
                in Bellingham, Washington she developed an interest in conflict resolution. So when heated discussions began happening in her community around Title IX
                implementations where school officials appeared to vilify certain groups of students. Then,
                later, nearby to her home, a student from this group
                <a href="https://www.kiro7.com/news/local/bellingham-high-student-attacked-being-transgender/E3CH4XLD6NGX3IULLWH5EHXUJ4/" target="_blank">
                    was attacked
                </a>
                she decided to investigate the debate.
                <ul><li>What had triggered it?</li><li>What were its outcomes?</li><li>How could the conflict be resolved without anyone else being hurt?</li></ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                When she attempted to answer these questions, she found the data extremely difficult to come by. Unsatisfied with giving up, she decided to apply her background in machine learning, software engineering,
                and data analysis to building her own dataset. This company is the result, as the problems she's solved along the way could be used to help many other people.
